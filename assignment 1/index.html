      <h2>Insight</h2>
      <p>What I've learned from Luni</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Interactivity as brand voice: motion/3D are not decoration, they communicate identity.</li>
        <li>Guided curiosity: visual cues (icons, layout, transitions) nudge exploration without heavy copy.</li>
        <li>Consistency matters: unified art style + type = clearer navigation and stronger memory.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="mac">Reflection</h2>
      <div class="skibidi">
        
      <p class="color">When I first visited luni.app, the thing that grabbed my attention was the 3D interactive menu — it looked super modern and unique, and the clean typography in the background made it feel really polished. I started scrolling and found Omada, got curious, and clicked on it to check it out. It turned out to be a really interesting app for sports fans, so I kept scrolling to read more about it and the team behind it. Honestly, I spent most of my time on the 3D interactive elements on every page because I couldn’t stop watching how every corner animated when I hovered or moved my mouse. The thing I did the most was clicking on almost every button, text, and object once I figured out how the site worked.</p>
      <p class="color">To me, the main goal of the site is to show off how creative Luni is at building digital brands, and it does that by making the whole website an interactive experience. You can explore their identity, projects, and team, and the visual design plus the navigation really help communicate that. I feel like someone interested in design would spend at least 15+ minutes here, exploring how the pages and transitions work. The playful 3D objects, text, and icons guide you naturally, and the consistent art style and typography make everything feel clear and connected.
</p>
      <p class="color">The site reminds me of games and playful digital interfaces, which makes it fun to explore freely and experiment without pressure. It’s relaxing, entertaining, and also makes you appreciate what Luni is capable of. The only frustrating part was the homepage menu — there’s the large 3D elements and the top-corner button, which are fine, but then there’s another page-switching section that felt kind of extra. The best part, though, is definitely the animations and transitions — they’re super smooth, and the cartoonish, modern, playful style makes the whole experience really satisfying to interact with.
</p>
<p class="color">Overall, the experience left me impressed with how much thought and creativity went into the site. It’s not just a portfolio or a showcase; it’s an interactive journey that makes exploring Luni fun, engaging, and inspiring.</p>
