I designed Reflor with the idea of slowing down interaction in a world that constantly pushes for speed. I wanted this project to feel alive, but in a quiet, patient way—something that makes people pause, breathe, and take in the small details. The idea came from reading about “Slow Technology” by Hallnäs and Redström (2001), which talks about creating technology that encourages reflection instead of rushing. I also looked at interactive projects like Patatap (2014), which inspired me in how simple actions can feel sensory and rewarding. But instead of energy and chaos, I wanted calmness and softness—a space where interaction feels natural, not demanding. Every element, from the motion of the flowers to the subtle fade of the interface, is meant to express patience and organic growth. The flowers don’t bloom instantly because I wanted users to wait and witness progress, like nurturing something in real life. That’s why the project includes watering and growth animations—it’s a metaphor for attention and care in digital space.
Visually, I leaned toward a minimalist and organic style. The background uses soft gradients and customizable tones that feel like changing skies, while the flowers are stylized but grounded in natural shapes. I chose to refine the SVG forms into layered petals with gentle gradients because it makes the bloom feel more believable without breaking the minimal aesthetic. The navigation bar is fixed and simple: “Reflor” on the left and three small links on the right—Garden, How It Works, and About—just enough to give direction without crowding the space. Typography also plays an important role. I used Abril Fatface for headings to give a crafted, human touch, and Inter for subtext to balance clarity and modernity. It’s about keeping things elegant but accessible. The toolbar on the side was designed with icons only because I wanted it to feel instinctive. When you hover, it quietly explains itself, creating small moments of discovery. The user can choose seeds, water them, or erase mistakes. I also added a reset button and a background color picker on the bottom left corner to let users shape their environment—it’s about giving creative control while keeping the interface peaceful.
Making Reflor work smoothly was a challenge, especially balancing design precision with interactive complexity. The hardest part was ensuring the animations felt natural—flowers growing too fast ruined the meaning, but too slow made it boring. I had to carefully tune timing and easing to find that emotional rhythm between patience and reward. I also faced some technical issues like syncing growth states, removing “undefined” errors, and maintaining flower consistency after refresh. But those moments taught me how design and code are deeply connected—it’s not just about visuals, but about how things *feel* when you use them. In the future, I’d love to expand Reflor into a full interactive installation with ambient sound or light that reacts to the user’s actions. I think that would make the sense of growth and reflection even stronger. Overall, Reflor is my personal reminder that technology doesn’t always have to rush—it can slow down and breathe.
