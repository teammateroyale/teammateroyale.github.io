<!-- DESIGN RATIONALE:For this project, I focused on redesigning the media player website and shaping it around a dark fantasy music/video context. My main aim was to create something immersive but still functional, where the design, usability, and interactivity all feel part of the same world.

I went with a dark palette—deep blacks with subtle purples—to set a mysterious and magical tone. To support that, I used gothic-inspired fonts that push the fantasy aesthetic while keeping the text easy to read. Even the smallest details, like the play/pause buttons, volume, and fullscreen controls, were styled so they feel integrated into the atmosphere instead of looking like standard UI parts dropped on top.

Functionality was just as important. I made sure every control is clear and responsive, with hover animations and soft effects to give instant feedback. The progress bar sits neatly under the video, keeping focus on the content, and I added small visual cues so users can always read their interactions at a glance. The layout was also built to adapt smoothly to both desktop and mobile screens.

To bring in something original, I added the Magic Card Collection feature. As users watch, they unlock cards tied to the dark fantasy theme. It’s a subtle but rewarding element that encourages engagement without pulling attention away from the video itself. The card pop-ups were designed to feel like rewards—present but never intrusive.

Overall, the goal was not just to make a media player work, but to make it belong to its theme—immersive, simple to use, and rewarding to explore. By combining a strong visual style, smooth usability, and a playful interactive layer, I aimed to create a design that not only meets the assignment requirements but also feels distinct and memorable. -->
